### Project Title: 
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
Analyzes bikeshare data for 3 major US cities, allowing users to examine demographics and routes based on user input.

### Files used
bikeshare.py, washington.csv, new_york_city.csv, chicago.csv

### Credits
Needed an outside refresher on how to put multiple if statements in a while loop to error proof month/day options.  I was able to infer a lot from this web page:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37666104/python-while-true-loop-nested-if-statement-indentation
and connect the dots to notes and lessons in Udacity.

Outside of that, it was mostly just reviewing the lessons, notes and a lot of fiddling/moving indents around and messing with syntax.
